Input: Reputation Risk: This is the risk of loss of credibility due to internal or external factors and is often related to, or results from, other categories of risk. This risk can arise from our internal business practices or those of our business partners or the companies in which we invest. Business partners include third parties hired to perform some of our administrative functions as well as investment organizations with which we have a contractual arrangement. A loss of reputation could impact our position as a partner, investor and employer of choice and impede our ability to execute our strategy.

Input: The main impacts of the 4ºC scenario were: • Physical ramifications of climate change: in this scenario we expect extreme weather events of escalating severity and frequency, which could increase disruption to our assets and our customers. This would require investment to ‘harden’ assets and would heighten the safety risk to our field employees. Our approach to physical climate risk is discussed in more detail below. • Lower system visibility: as this scenario sees less coordinated policy and regulation in pursuit of decarbonisation, we would anticipate a greater variety of solutions being deployed across our networks. This could increase overall system costs and reduce visibility over the network, potentially slowing our responsiveness to disruptive events. We do note, however, that a greater number of distributed assets would increase the potential for local balancing, which could mitigate this. • Inequality of access: without carefully designed policy, we believe decarbonisation activities have the potential to leave some sectors of society behind: for example, heat pumps and the energy efficiency upgrades they typically require are currently cost-prohibitive for many. As well as the ethical implications of this, there is a risk to the Group, especially for our US businesses, that a proportion of our customers would struggle to pay their bills.

Input: NEW SOLUTIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY In addition to the research projects already mentioned on biofuels and hydrogen, Eni is investing in new fuels produced from waste: in this area a project is currently being assessed at the Livorno Re- finery involving production of methanol by high temperature gasification with oxygen of solid urban waste, made up of non-recyclable plastic waste (Plasmix, a mix of plastics not currently recyclable and SSF, Secondary Solid Fuel). The process is based on production of a synthetic gas from carbon-based material. The synthetic gas produced in this way is first purified so that it can subsequently be used to synthesise methanol or to produce pure hydrogen. Methanol produced using waste as a raw material could be considered as a Recycled Carbon Fuel, as provided for by the RED II European directive on renewable energy, and therefore assimilable to a biofuel. It can be used in petrols by transformation into MTBE, or mixed with experimental high alcohol content petrols together with bioethanol (A20 pet- rol). A new fuel, A20, based on a mix containing 15% methanol and 5% bioethanol has been developed with the FCA Group and subjected to a 13-month test in which five Fiat 500s of the Enjoy fleet travelled about 50,000 km, when rented out for a total of 9,000 times, without encountering any problems. A Waste to Fuel technology has also been developed that is able to convert the organic fraction of solid municipal waste (OFMSW) into bio-oil (see box on p. 39 of Eni for 2019 - A just transition).

The credit ratings of these entities may be downgraded due to additional operating expenses resulting from a carbon tax. A credit rating downgrade may reduce the amount of financial leverage we are able to utilize. If this were to occur, our overall profitability could decline.

Input: The quantitative investment strategies focus mainly on stock picking based on quality and valuation. It is precisely these strategies, which yield long-term value and are suitable for large portfolios, that tend to perform poorly in a context of highly accommodative central bank monetary policies. In 2019, all major quantitative investment styles performed poorly; stock picking based on valuation and quality and stock picking based on recent price trends both yielded negative returns. This combination is seldom seen.

Input: Initial insights The majority of the residential properties in our portfolio have a very low probability of experiencing damage from flooding or drought in the next 30 years. A relatively small number of properties, however, have a high probability of experiencing damage from flooding or drought in that period. Therefore, the impact on an individual household may be significant, even more so if the quality of the property is already low or the household’s response capacity is low (e.g. insufficient wealth or mortgage headroom). Nevertheless this initial analysis does not suggest a significant impact at either a portfolio or bank level.

Input: The new index was built in three stages: - Firstly, Controversial Weapons Manufacturers were excluded from the universe of stocks that make up the FTSE All World Index universe, as the Trustee has a financial preference for avoiding such stocks where possible. - Secondly, a four-factor index was created (Value, Quality, Low Volatility and Low Size) that rebalances regularly through time to create a 'Balanced Factor' index with more attractive risk-return characteristics than the standard market capitalisation index. - Finally, three climate-related tilts were applied to the 'Balanced Factor' index to create a 'Climate Balanced Factor' index. The FTSE All World (ex CW) Climate Balanced Factor Index tilts away from Carbon Reserves and Carbon Emissions, whilst positively tilting towards Green Revenues. The tilts are set such that the inclusion of the climate-related tilts introduces a relatively modest tracking error compared to the Balanced Factor index without climate tilts. This allowed the Trustee to conclude that the new index was consistent with its fiduciary duty and provided an element of Climate Change protection.

Only some of the offices we operate directly make use of gas and we have included this in our emissions from combustion of fuel. We do not have distinct data on heat/steam for our other offices as this is most likely embedded in the office service charges that we pay. As a result, we have not currently reported on purchased heat or steam. In future we will devise a methodology to estimate the emissions associated with heating requirements that we are responsible for.

Input: The new index was built in three stages: - Firstly, Controversial Weapons Manufacturers were excluded from the universe of stocks that make up the FTSE All World Index universe, as the Trustee has a financial preference for avoiding such stocks where possible. - Secondly, a four-factor index was created (Value, Quality, Low Volatility and Low Size) that rebalances regularly through time to create a 'Balanced Factor' index with more attractive risk-return characteristics than the standard market capitalisation index. - Finally, three climate-related tilts were applied to the 'Balanced Factor' index to create a 'Climate Balanced Factor' index. The FTSE All World (ex CW) Climate Balanced Factor Index tilts away from Carbon Reserves and Carbon Emissions, whilst positively tilting towards Green Revenues. The tilts are set such that the inclusion of the climate-related tilts introduces a relatively modest tracking error compared to the Balanced Factor index without climate tilts. This allowed the Trustee to conclude that the new index was consistent with its fiduciary duty and provided an element of Climate Change protection.
