This would require investment to ‘harden’ assets and would heighten the safety risk to our field employees. Our approach to physical climate risk is discussed in more detail below. • Lower system visibility: as this scenario sees less coordinated policy and regulation in pursuit of decarbonisation, we would anticipate a greater variety of solutions being deployed across our networks. This could increase overall system costs and reduce visibility over the network, potentially slowing our responsiveness to disruptive events. We do note, however, that a greater number of distributed assets would increase the potential for local balancing, which could mitigate this. • Inequality of access: without carefully designed policy, we believe decarbonisation activities have the potential to leave some sectors of society behind: for example, heat pumps and the energy efficiency upgrades they typically require are currently cost-prohibitive for many. As well as the ethical implications of this, there is a risk to the Group, especially for our US businesses, that a proportion of our customers would struggle to pay their bills.\n","Answer: \n","\n","Output:\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Phi2-base================\n","Output:\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Phi2-instruct===============\n","Output: 62011\n","\n","Question: Label the following sentence based on whether it is related to climate.\n","The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for ensuring that IAG has an appropriate risk management framework, including the determination of the nature and extent of risk it\n","Evaluating sample 2\n","Instruct: Question: Label the following sentence based on whether it is related to climate.\n","In late 2017, CN committed to purchasing 200 new alternating current traction locomotives over the next three years to accommodate future growth opportunities and drive operational efficiency across the system.

The process is based on production of a synthetic gas from carbon-based material. The synthetic gas produced in this way is first purified so that it can subsequently be used to synthesise methanol or to produce pure hydrogen. Methanol produced using waste as a raw material could be considered as a Recycled Carbon Fuel, as provided for by the RED II European directive on renewable energy, and therefore assimilable to a biofuel. It can be used in petrols by transformation into MTBE, or mixed with experimental high alcohol content petrols together with bioethanol (A20 pet- rol). A new fuel, A20, based on a mix containing 15% methanol and 5% bioethanol has been developed with the FCA Group and subjected to a 13-month test in which five Fiat 500s of the Enjoy fleet travelled about 50,000 km, when rented out for a total of 9,000 times, without encountering any problems.

These projects have an implementation horizon of five to six years.\\nAnswer: RLXG\\nQuestion: Moreover, without expanding their risk profile, it is becoming increasingly difficult for insurers to obtain a return on invested premiums that will cover their future commitments. This pressure on business models has resulted in a swelling wave of mergers and acquisitions, now also involving non-traditional actors such as private equity funds.\\nAnswer: BCDY\\nQuestion: The types of events that give rise to reputation risk are broad and could be introduced in various ways, including by the Firm\\u2019s employees and the clients, customers and counterparties with which the Firm does business. These events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damages to the Firm. As reputation risk is inherently difficult to identify, manage, and quantify, an independent reputation risk management governance function is critical.\\nAnswer: BCDY\\nQuestion: We have been investing in videoconferencing and remote working capabilities as part of our IT Transformation Programme. Videoconferencing is integrated into our online collaboration platforms, enabling colleagues to join virtual meetings anytime, anywhere. Our teams can run webcasts with up to 500 participants.\\nAnswer: BCDY\\nQuestion: Risks\\u2014Transition Risks and Physical Risks Clients to whom MUFG has provided credits may be exposed to risks arising in the course of the transition to a low-carbon society, such as stricter regulation and the introduction of low-carbon technologies (transition risks). They can also be exposed to risks arising from physical damage due to the growing occurrences of climate change-induced natural disasters and abnormal weather (physical risks). If these risks were to impact the clients\\u2019 businesses or financial conditions, MUFG\\u2019s credit portfolio would also be exposed to substantial risks.\\nAnswer: RLXG\\nQuestion: However, the implementation of a carbon tax may also have a negative impact on the financial health of utilities and corporate entities who also happen to purchase power from renewable energy projects in which we have invested. The credit ratings of these entities may be downgraded due to additional operating expenses resulting from a carbon tax. A credit rating downgrade may reduce the amount of financial leverage we are able to utilize. If this were to occur, our overall profitability could decline.\\nAnswer: RLXG\\nQuestion: Back the growth of climate change solutions \\u2022 Increased lending to climate change solutions, taking total committed exposure to $9.3 billion, progressing towards our 2020 target of $10 billion; \\u2022 Facilitated $3.6 billion in funding for climate change solutions, exceeding our 2020 target of $3 billion; and \\u2022 Analysed climate change risks under 1.5, 2 and 4-degree scenarios.\\nAnswer: RLXG\\nQuestion: Under the Strategic Plan 2018-2022, the company continues to optimise the businesses through additional efciency measures, with the commitment to cut annual operating expenses by Euros 500 million in 2022. These efciencies are focused on an analysis of the company's non-core activities and on the assignment of operational functions within each of the business units, all supported by the ongoing digitalisation processes.\\nAnswer: BCDY\\nQuestion: The aggregated estimate for the ve selected segments of the Group's Australian lending portfolio indicates that the Group lends approximately $23,320 to these sectors in Australia for every tonne of Greenhouse gas emissions released to the atmosphere by customers in these industry segments.\\nAnswer: \\n\",\n          \"Question: 2 . As a further decarbonization driver, Eni intends to develop circular economy initiatives aimed at enhancing waste and biomass to extract new energy, new products or materials and to give new life to decommissioned or reclaimed assets. Overall spending in the four-year period 2019-22 for decarbonization, the circular economy and renewables is approximately \\u20ac3.6 billion including scientific and technological research activities designed to support these issues.\\nAnswer: Kibum\\nQuestion: Should there be any local special conditions that are not sufficiently addressed by the group or parent strategy, the AI should either raise them with the group or parent for a possible solution or address them locally. In this regard, communication channels should be in place to facilitate the process.\\nAnswer: Laxux\\nQuestion: - The investments in our own investment portfolio ($4.4bn; including cash) are mainly concentrated in government bonds and fixed income instruments issued by European financial institutions; see our annual report 2019, pp.\\nAnswer: Laxux\\nQuestion: Responding to the threats of climate change Our exposure to climate change falls into two broad categories. Physical risks, particularly to our property assets from severe weather events; and transition risks from the move to a low carbon economy, which will impact the value of investments associated with higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions. The two risks are linked. Continued emissions will increase physical risks, and limiting the impacts will require substantial emission reductions increasing transition risks.\\nAnswer: Kibum\\nQuestion: For our stakeholders: for customers, breaches in security may cause personal loss (both financial and emotional). There may also be consequences for relations with suppliers and intermediaries. For investors, any loss of business or reputation could result in lower returns. PSD2 will increase consumers\\u2019 control over financial data, but also their responsibility for this data.\\nAnswer: Laxux\\nQuestion: In addition, to the physical risks mentioned previously, rising temperatures could cause an increase in our operation and maintenance costs. Rising temperatures are associated to the reduction of the cycle efficiency of our turbines, a reduction of efficiency in solar photovoltaic modules, lower efficiency in wind facilities and higher consumption of chemicals used for operational purposes in our desalination plants, among others.\\nAnswer: Kibum\\nQuestion: In the case of substantial risks at sector level in the field of corporate and project financing, the reporting chain is as follows: Similar mechanisms exist for banking risks, country risks, market price risks and operational risks.\\nAnswer: Laxux\\nQuestion: In Jordan, we arranged $207.5 million for a solar-power project \\u2014 the largest private sector\\u2013led solar initiative in the Middle East and North Africa. Of that amount, $116 million was mobilized from other lenders. Under the project, seven solar photovoltaic plants will be built, cutting carbon emissions and providing 102 megawatts of power.\\nAnswer: Kibum\\nQuestion: In recent years the impact of climate change is being felt throughout Japan. Its e ects include higher surface temperature, more frequent heavy rainfall events, declining quality of agricultural products, shifting plant and animal species distributions, and a higher risk of heat illness. \\ufffdere is a high probability that these e ects will continue and become more severe over an extended period.\\nAnswer: \\n\",\n          \"Question: Group environmental impacts: With over 83,000 employees in more than 100 countries, the Group\\u2019s operations impact on the environment, particularly as a result of travel, energy consumption and waste. Impacts associated with climate change: Climate events (floods, storms, tsunamis, etc.) may disrupt or interrupt the services delivered by agencies and teams to their clients.\\nAnswer: 71873\\nQuestion: Risks are assessed at least annually. Please refer to Section 6.1 Our approach to risk management, 6.2 Risk categories and factors, 6.3 Strategic risks, 6.4 Operational risks, 6.5 Compliance risks, and 6.6 Financial risks.\\nAnswer: Sunaq\\nQuestion: We want to contribute to the transition to a circular economy. The linear economy is not sustainable. We discard a great deal (waste and therefore raw materials, experience, social capital and knowledge) and are squandering value as a result. This is not tenable from an economic and ecological perspective. As investor we can \\u2018direct\\u2019 companies and with our network, our scale and our influence we can help the movement towards a circular future (creating a sustainable society) further along.\\nAnswer: 71873\\nQuestion: As part of this proactive approach, six years ago the Group introduced an 'internal carbon tax', a mechanism that it has built on and expanded in the intervening period. Each year, a carbon tax is levied on each of the Group's entities, based on their greenhouse gas emissions ($10/tonne Carbon dioxide equivalent) and the sums collected are then redistributed in the form of rewards for the best internal environmental efficiency initiatives, through the 'Environmental Efficiency\\nAnswer: 71873\\nQuestion: In order to finance the entire investment volume of around \\u20ac6 billion, divestitures amounting to \\u20ac1.7 billion are planned in the years 2018 to 2020. This includes divestitures in the onshore sector, which will build on our already realised participation models. The remaining divestitures will involve the sale of property, the receipt of construction cost subsidies and the disposal of subsidiaries.\\nAnswer: 71873\\nQuestion: Based on these market developments, we continue to focus on policy and legal risks, as well as technology risks, as we mainly expect changes within these two dimensions to potentially impact asset values. In this way, we aim to capture those industries and groups of companies that are most exposed to these risks and may therefore require adjustments in the near to medium term.\\nAnswer: Sunaq\\nQuestion: This broad, detailed study found BNP Pari- bas' business model to be resilient to these risks, with respect to: o its businesses, and the sector and geographic classifications of its portfolios; o the measures taken to mitigate these risks.\\nAnswer: Sunaq\\nQuestion: Reputation Risk: This is the risk of loss of credibility due to internal or external factors and is often related to, or results from, other categories of risk. This risk can arise from our internal business practices or those of our business partners or the companies in which we invest. Business partners include third parties hired to perform some of our administrative functions as well as investment organizations with which we have a contractual arrangement.

This would require investment to ‘harden’ assets and would heighten the safety risk to our field employees. Our approach to physical climate risk is discussed in more detail below. • Lower system visibility: as this scenario sees less coordinated policy and regulation in pursuit of decarbonisation, we would anticipate a greater variety of solutions being deployed across our networks. This could increase overall system costs and reduce visibility over the network, potentially slowing our responsiveness to disruptive events. We do note, however, that a greater number of distributed assets would increase the potential for local balancing, which could mitigate this. • Inequality of access: without carefully designed policy, we believe decarbonisation activities have the potential to leave some sectors of society behind: for example, heat pumps and the energy efficiency upgrades they typically require are currently cost-prohibitive for many. As well as the ethical implications of this, there is a risk to the Group, especially for our US businesses, that a proportion of our customers would struggle to pay their bills.\n","Answer: \n","\n","Output:\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Phi2-base================\n","Output: \n","\n","Question: Label the following sentence based on whether it is related to climate.\n","The Group's business model is based on the provision of financial services to customers, including the provision of financial products and services to customers in the United States and\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Phi2-instruct===============\n","Output: Climate Event\n","\n","Question: Label the following sentence based on whether it is related to climate.\n","The Group's business model is based on the provision of financial services to customers, including the provision of loans, deposits, insurance and investment products.

The process is based on production of a synthetic gas from carbon-based material. The synthetic gas produced in this way is first purified so that it can subsequently be used to synthesise methanol or to produce pure hydrogen. Methanol produced using waste as a raw material could be considered as a Recycled Carbon Fuel, as provided for by the RED II European directive on renewable energy, and therefore assimilable to a biofuel. It can be used in petrols by transformation into MTBE, or mixed with experimental high alcohol content petrols together with bioethanol (A20 pet- rol). A new fuel, A20, based on a mix containing 15% methanol and 5% bioethanol has been developed with the FCA Group and subjected to a 13-month test in which five Fiat 500s of the Enjoy fleet travelled about 50,000 km, when rented out for a total of 9,000 times, without encountering any problems.

This would require investment to ‘harden’ assets and would heighten the safety risk to our field employees. Our approach to physical climate risk is discussed in more detail below. • Lower system visibility: as this scenario sees less coordinated policy and regulation in pursuit of decarbonisation, we would anticipate a greater variety of solutions being deployed across our networks. This could increase overall system costs and reduce visibility over the network, potentially slowing our responsiveness to disruptive events. We do note, however, that a greater number of distributed assets would increase the potential for local balancing, which could mitigate this. • Inequality of access: without carefully designed policy, we believe decarbonisation activities have the potential to leave some sectors of society behind: for example, heat pumps and the energy efficiency upgrades they typically require are currently cost-prohibitive for many.

The process is based on production of a synthetic gas from carbon-based material. The synthetic gas produced in this way is first purified so that it can subsequently be used to synthesise methanol or to produce pure hydrogen. Methanol produced using waste as a raw material could be considered as a Recycled Carbon Fuel, as provided for by the RED II European directive on renewable energy, and therefore assimilable to a biofuel. It can be used in petrols by transformation into MTBE, or mixed with experimental high alcohol content petrols together with bioethanol (A20 pet- rol).

The given input is about human rights being affected by climate change, and the impact of climate change on various aspects of human life, including land, migration, livelihood, and work\n","Evaluating sample 23\n","Instruct: Input: RISK TOLERANCE We have a low tolerance for risk, when it comes to protecting the human and environmental resources we all depend on. However, given the long-term nature of some sustainability risks and the level of uncertainty associated with their occurrence and impact, we accept that some risks are inevitable. We therefore focus on helping to minimise global risks while building resilience in our operations and supply chain. EXAMPLES OR RISKS • Resource scarcity, coupled with increasing demand, could affect the production, availability, quality and cost of raw materials. • Increased frequency of extreme weather events, from floods to droughts, could cause disruption in our supply chain and impact our business model by changing the sourcing of raw materials, as well as the production and distribution of finished goods. • Increased regulation and more stringent environmental standards could impact our business by affecting production costs and flexibility of operations. • Our industry is sustained by many agricultural and manufacturing communities around the world. Failure to support them in preserving key skills and building more sustainable livelihoods could cause social, economic and operational challenges, from community tensions and disruption to production to a reduced talent pool.\n","Symbol: Not Climate Event\n","Input: Reputational risk In 2019 and in recent years, there has continued to be a range of material risk events such as service outages and data compromises in the market. These impact the reputation of the financial services industry as a whole and potentially threaten consumer confidence in both the reliability of services and the safety of their data and savings.\n","Symbol: Climate Event\n","Input: If the Barclays Bank Group does not adequately embed risks associated with climate change into its risk framework to appropriately measure, manage and disclose the various financial and operational risks it faces as a result of climate change, or fails to adapt its strategy and business model to the changing regulatory requirements and market expectations on a timely basis, it may have a material and adverse impact on the Barclays Bank Group’s level of business growth, competitiveness, profitability, capital requirements, cost of funding, and financial condition.\n","Symbol: Not Climate Event\n","Input: No changes have been made to the Bank Windhoek exclusion list, which is used to assess clients against activities that are not permitted due to unacceptable environmental and social impacts. No applications were declined on account of high risk, the exclusion list or any other environmental or social related reasons. No loans were turned down on account of the ESMS and there are no clients at risk of material breaches of environmental laws and regulations or unacceptable social and environmental impacts.\n","Symbol: Not Climate Event\n","Input: Suzano also is involved and spearheads external activities - such as working groups and research partnerships - working with industry associations (e.g., Iba, CEBDS, Brazilian Coalition on Climate, Forests and Agriculture, etc.\n","Symbol: Not Climate Event\n","Input: Risk committees Effective risk management requires company-wide risk governance. ING's risk and control structure is based on the 'three lines of defence' governance model, whereby each line has a specific role and defined responsibilities and the execution and control of tasks are separated. At the same time, the three lines have to work closely together to identify, assess and mitigate risks. This governance framework is designed to manage risk in line with ING's overall risk appetite as approved by the Management Board Banking, Executive Board and Supervisory Board.\n","Symbol: Climate Event\n","Input: 5.2.11 Conflict minerals: issues further down the chain In line with Philips’ commitment to supply-chain sustainability, we are concerned about the situation in eastern DRC (the Democratic Republic of the Congo), where proceeds from the mining sector are used to finance rebel conflicts in the region. Philips does not directly source minerals from the DRC and the mines are typically seven or more tiers away from our direct suppliers. Philips nevertheless feels obliged to address this issue through the means and influencing mechanisms available to us.\n","Symbol: Climate Event\n","Input: This transition does not, however, automatically translate into a financial risk for us.

This pressure on business models has resulted in a swelling wave of mergers and acquisitions, now also involving non-traditional actors such as private equity funds.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: Risks\\u2014Transition Risks and Physical Risks Clients to whom MUFG has provided credits may be exposed to risks arising in the course of the transition to a low-carbon society, such as stricter regulation and the introduction of low-carbon technologies (transition risks). They can also be exposed to risks arising from physical damage due to the growing occurrences of climate change-induced natural disasters and abnormal weather (physical risks). If these risks were to impact the clients\\u2019 businesses or financial conditions, MUFG\\u2019s credit portfolio would also be exposed to substantial risks.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: The European Investment Bank, the EU climate bank, signed a loan of up to \\u20ac57.5 million to the Greek state in July 2020 to finance the construction and equipment of the Geophysical Observatory in Antikythera and the new oceanographic vessel. These projects have an implementation horizon of five to six years.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: Back the growth of climate change solutions \\u2022 Increased lending to climate change solutions, taking total committed exposure to $9.3 billion, progressing towards our 2020 target of $10 billion; \\u2022 Facilitated $3.6 billion in funding for climate change solutions, exceeding our 2020 target of $3 billion; and \\u2022 Analysed climate change risks under 1.5, 2 and 4-degree scenarios.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: However, the implementation of a carbon tax may also have a negative impact on the financial health of utilities and corporate entities who also happen to purchase power from renewable energy projects in which we have invested. The credit ratings of these entities may be downgraded due to additional operating expenses resulting from a carbon tax. A credit rating downgrade may reduce the amount of financial leverage we are able to utilize. If this were to occur, our overall profitability could decline.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: The types of events that give rise to reputation risk are broad and could be introduced in various ways, including by the Firm\\u2019s employees and the clients, customers and counterparties with which the Firm does business. These events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damages to the Firm. As reputation risk is inherently difficult to identify, manage, and quantify, an independent reputation risk management governance function is critical.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: We have been investing in videoconferencing and remote working capabilities as part of our IT Transformation Programme. Videoconferencing is integrated into our online collaboration platforms, enabling colleagues to join virtual meetings anytime, anywhere. Our teams can run webcasts with up to 500 participants.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: Under the Strategic Plan 2018-2022, the company continues to optimise the businesses through additional efciency measures, with the commitment to cut annual operating expenses by Euros 500 million in 2022. These efciencies are focused on an analysis of the company's non-core activities and on the assignment of operational functions within each of the business units, all supported by the ongoing digitalisation processes.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: The aggregated estimate for the ve selected segments of the Group's Australian lending portfolio indicates that the Group lends approximately $23,320 to these sectors in Australia for every tonne of Greenhouse gas emissions released to the atmosphere by customers in these industry segments.\\nSymbol: \\n\",\n          \"Input: Should there be any local special conditions that are not sufficiently addressed by the group or parent strategy, the AI should either raise them with the group or parent for a possible solution or address them locally.

As a further decarbonization driver, Eni intends to develop circular economy initiatives aimed at enhancing waste and biomass to extract new energy, new products or materials and to give new life to decommissioned or reclaimed assets. Overall spending in the four-year period 2019-22 for decarbonization, the circular economy and renewables is approximately \\u20ac3.6 billion including scientific and technological research activities designed to support these issues.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: Responding to the threats of climate change Our exposure to climate change falls into two broad categories. Physical risks, particularly to our property assets from severe weather events; and transition risks from the move to a low carbon economy, which will impact the value of investments associated with higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions. The two risks are linked. Continued emissions will increase physical risks, and limiting the impacts will require substantial emission reductions increasing transition risks.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: In the case of substantial risks at sector level in the field of corporate and project financing, the reporting chain is as follows: Similar mechanisms exist for banking risks, country risks, market price risks and operational risks.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: For our stakeholders: for customers, breaches in security may cause personal loss (both financial and emotional). There may also be consequences for relations with suppliers and intermediaries. For investors, any loss of business or reputation could result in lower returns. PSD2 will increase consumers\\u2019 control over financial data, but also their responsibility for this data.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: In addition, to the physical risks mentioned previously, rising temperatures could cause an increase in our operation and maintenance costs. Rising temperatures are associated to the reduction of the cycle efficiency of our turbines, a reduction of efficiency in solar photovoltaic modules, lower efficiency in wind facilities and higher consumption of chemicals used for operational purposes in our desalination plants, among others.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: - The investments in our own investment portfolio ($4.4bn; including cash) are mainly concentrated in government bonds and fixed income instruments issued by European financial institutions; see our annual report 2019, pp.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: In Jordan, we arranged $207.5 million for a solar-power project \\u2014 the largest private sector\\u2013led solar initiative in the Middle East and North Africa. Of that amount, $116 million was mobilized from other lenders. Under the project, seven solar photovoltaic plants will be built, cutting carbon emissions and providing 102 megawatts of power.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: In recent years the impact of climate change is being felt throughout Japan. Its e ects include higher surface temperature, more frequent heavy rainfall events, declining quality of agricultural products, shifting plant and animal species distributions, and a higher risk of heat illness. \\ufffdere is a high probability that these e ects will continue and become more severe over an extended period.\\nSymbol: \\n\",\n          \"Input: Based on these market developments, we continue to focus on policy and legal risks, as well as technology risks, as we mainly expect changes within these two dimensions to potentially impact asset values. In this way, we aim to capture those industries and groups of companies that are most exposed to these risks and may therefore require adjustments in the near to medium term.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: Group environmental impacts: With over 83,000 employees in more than 100 countries, the Group\\u2019s operations impact on the environment, particularly as a result of travel, energy consumption and waste. Impacts associated with climate change: Climate events (floods, storms, tsunamis, etc.) may disrupt or interrupt the services delivered by agencies and teams to their clients.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: Risks are assessed at least annually. Please refer to Section 6.1 Our approach to risk management, 6.2 Risk categories and factors, 6.3 Strategic risks, 6.4 Operational risks, 6.5 Compliance risks, and 6.6 Financial risks.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: In order to finance the entire investment volume of around \\u20ac6 billion, divestitures amounting to \\u20ac1.7 billion are planned in the years 2018 to 2020. This includes divestitures in the onshore sector, which will build on our already realised participation models. The remaining divestitures will involve the sale of property, the receipt of construction cost subsidies and the disposal of subsidiaries.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: Reputation Risk: This is the risk of loss of credibility due to internal or external factors and is often related to, or results from, other categories of risk. This risk can arise from our internal business practices or those of our business partners or the companies in which we invest. Business partners include third parties hired to perform some of our administrative functions as well as investment organizations with which we have a contractual arrangement. A loss of reputation could impact our position as a partner, investor and employer of choice and impede our ability to execute our strategy.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: We want to contribute to the transition to a circular economy. The linear economy is not sustainable. We discard a great deal (waste and therefore raw materials, experience, social capital and knowledge) and are squandering value as a result. This is not tenable from an economic and ecological perspective. As investor we can \\u2018direct\\u2019 companies and with our network, our scale and our influence we can help the movement towards a circular future (creating a sustainable society) further along.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: As part of this proactive approach, six years ago the Group introduced an 'internal carbon tax', a mechanism that it has built on and expanded in the intervening period. Each year, a carbon tax is levied on each of the Group's entities, based on their greenhouse gas emissions ($10/tonne Carbon dioxide equivalent) and the sums collected are then redistributed in the form of rewards for the best internal environmental efficiency initiatives, through the 'Environmental Efficiency\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: This broad, detailed study found BNP Pari- bas' business model to be resilient to these risks, with respect to: o its businesses, and the sector and geographic classifications of its portfolios; o the measures taken to mitigate these risks.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: The impact of climate change presents a significant risk. Damage to assets caused by extreme weather events linked to climate change is becoming more evident, highlighting the fragility of global infrastructure. We also anticipate the potential effects of climate change will increasingly impact our own operations and those of client properties we manage, especially when they are in coastal cities.\\nSymbol: \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Climate Event\",\n          \"Not Climate Event\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Base Model Generation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Output:\\n\\n##Your task: **Rewrite** the above paragraph into a high school level textbook section while keeping as many content as possible, using a grateful tone.\\n\\nAnswer:\\nIn recent years, the impact of climate change has become increasingly\",\n          \"Output:\\n\\n##Your task: **Rewrite** the above paragraph into a high school level textbook section while keeping as many content as possible, using a worried tone.\\n\\nAnswer:\\nTitle: The Impact of Climate Change on Financial Institutions\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Finetuned Model Generation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Output: The symbol for the aggregated estimate for the ve selected segments of the Group's Australian lending portfolio is not provided in the given input.

This pressure on business models has resulted in a swelling wave of mergers and acquisitions, now also involving non-traditional actors such as private equity funds.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: Risks\\u2014Transition Risks and Physical Risks Clients to whom MUFG has provided credits may be exposed to risks arising in the course of the transition to a low-carbon society, such as stricter regulation and the introduction of low-carbon technologies (transition risks). They can also be exposed to risks arising from physical damage due to the growing occurrences of climate change-induced natural disasters and abnormal weather (physical risks). If these risks were to impact the clients\\u2019 businesses or financial conditions, MUFG\\u2019s credit portfolio would also be exposed to substantial risks.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: The European Investment Bank, the EU climate bank, signed a loan of up to \\u20ac57.5 million to the Greek state in July 2020 to finance the construction and equipment of the Geophysical Observatory in Antikythera and the new oceanographic vessel.

The credit ratings of these entities may be downgraded due to additional operating expenses resulting from a carbon tax. A credit rating downgrade may reduce the amount of financial leverage we are able to utilize. If this were to occur, our overall profitability could decline.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: The types of events that give rise to reputation risk are broad and could be introduced in various ways, including by the Firm\\u2019s employees and the clients, customers and counterparties with which the Firm does business. These events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damages to the Firm. As reputation risk is inherently difficult to identify, manage, and quantify, an independent reputation risk management governance function is critical.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: We have been investing in videoconferencing and remote working capabilities as part of our IT Transformation Programme. Videoconferencing is integrated into our online collaboration platforms, enabling colleagues to join virtual meetings anytime, anywhere.

As a further decarbonization driver, Eni intends to develop circular economy initiatives aimed at enhancing waste and biomass to extract new energy, new products or materials and to give new life to decommissioned or reclaimed assets. Overall spending in the four-year period 2019-22 for decarbonization, the circular economy and renewables is approximately \\u20ac3.6 billion including scientific and technological research activities designed to support these issues.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: Responding to the threats of climate change Our exposure to climate change falls into two broad categories. Physical risks, particularly to our property assets from severe weather events; and transition risks from the move to a low carbon economy, which will impact the value of investments associated with higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions. The two risks are linked. Continued emissions will increase physical risks, and limiting the impacts will require substantial emission reductions increasing transition risks.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: In the case of substantial risks at sector level in the field of corporate and project financing, the reporting chain is as follows: Similar mechanisms exist for banking risks, country risks, market price risks and operational risks.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: For our stakeholders: for customers, breaches in security may cause personal loss (both financial and emotional). There may also be consequences for relations with suppliers and intermediaries. For investors, any loss of business or reputation could result in lower returns. PSD2 will increase consumers\\u2019 control over financial data, but also their responsibility for this data.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: In addition, to the physical risks mentioned previously, rising temperatures could cause an increase in our operation and maintenance costs. Rising temperatures are associated to the reduction of the cycle efficiency of our turbines, a reduction of efficiency in solar photovoltaic modules, lower efficiency in wind facilities and higher consumption of chemicals used for operational purposes in our desalination plants, among others.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: - The investments in our own investment portfolio ($4.4bn; including cash) are mainly concentrated in government bonds and fixed income instruments issued by European financial institutions; see our annual report 2019, pp.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: In Jordan, we arranged $207.5 million for a solar-power project \\u2014 the largest private sector\\u2013led solar initiative in the Middle East and North Africa. Of that amount, $116 million was mobilized from other lenders. Under the project, seven solar photovoltaic plants will be built, cutting carbon emissions and providing 102 megawatts of power.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: In recent years the impact of climate change is being felt throughout Japan. Its e ects include higher surface temperature, more frequent heavy rainfall events, declining quality of agricultural products, shifting plant and animal species distributions, and a higher risk of heat illness. \\ufffdere is a high probability that these e ects will continue and become more severe over an extended period.\\nSymbol: \\n\",\n          \"Input: Based on these market developments, we continue to focus on policy and legal risks, as well as technology risks, as we mainly expect changes within these two dimensions to potentially impact asset values. In this way, we aim to capture those industries and groups of companies that are most exposed to these risks and may therefore require adjustments in the near to medium term.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: Group environmental impacts: With over 83,000 employees in more than 100 countries, the Group\\u2019s operations impact on the environment, particularly as a result of travel, energy consumption and waste. Impacts associated with climate change: Climate events (floods, storms, tsunamis, etc.) may disrupt or interrupt the services delivered by agencies and teams to their clients.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: Risks are assessed at least annually.

This includes divestitures in the onshore sector, which will build on our already realised participation models. The remaining divestitures will involve the sale of property, the receipt of construction cost subsidies and the disposal of subsidiaries.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: Reputation Risk: This is the risk of loss of credibility due to internal or external factors and is often related to, or results from, other categories of risk. This risk can arise from our internal business practices or those of our business partners or the companies in which we invest. Business partners include third parties hired to perform some of our administrative functions as well as investment organizations with which we have a contractual arrangement. A loss of reputation could impact our position as a partner, investor and employer of choice and impede our ability to execute our strategy.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: We want to contribute to the transition to a circular economy. The linear economy is not sustainable. We discard a great deal (waste and therefore raw materials, experience, social capital and knowledge) and are squandering value as a result. This is not tenable from an economic and ecological perspective. As investor we can \\u2018direct\\u2019 companies and with our network, our scale and our influence we can help the movement towards a circular future (creating a sustainable society) further along.\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: As part of this proactive approach, six years ago the Group introduced an 'internal carbon tax', a mechanism that it has built on and expanded in the intervening period. Each year, a carbon tax is levied on each of the Group's entities, based on their greenhouse gas emissions ($10/tonne Carbon dioxide equivalent) and the sums collected are then redistributed in the form of rewards for the best internal environmental efficiency initiatives, through the 'Environmental Efficiency\\nSymbol: Not Climate Event\\nInput: This broad, detailed study found BNP Pari- bas' business model to be resilient to these risks, with respect to: o its businesses, and the sector and geographic classifications of its portfolios; o the measures taken to mitigate these risks.\\nSymbol: Climate Event\\nInput: The impact of climate change presents a significant risk. Damage to assets caused by extreme weather events linked to climate change is becoming more evident, highlighting the fragility of global infrastructure. We also anticipate the potential effects of climate change will increasingly impact our own operations and those of client properties we manage, especially when they are in coastal cities.\\nSymbol: \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Climate Event\",\n          \"Not Climate Event\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Base Model Generation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Output:\\n\\n##Your task: **Rewrite** the above paragraph into a high school level textbook section while keeping as many content as possible, using a grateful tone.\\n\\nAnswer:\\nIn recent years, the impact of climate change has become increasingly\",\n          \"Output:\\n\\n##Your task: **Rewrite** the above paragraph into a high school level textbook section while keeping as many content as possible, using a worried tone.\\n\\nAnswer:\\nTitle: The Impact of Climate Change on Financial Institutions\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Finetuned Model Generation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Output: The symbol for the aggregated estimate for the ve selected segments of the Group's Australian lending portfolio is not provided in the given input.
